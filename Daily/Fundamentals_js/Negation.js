A ! sign in front of true makes the expression result in false. If something is not true, it has to be
false.

The ! sign is the negation operator. It turns values into their opposite.

The ! operator before false changes its value, too. If a value is not false. it has to be true.
*/

/*
We can use the ! operator with variables to negate the values they store.

We can save a whole negation in another variable too.
Create the variable isEvening and use ! to change isMorning to false.
