// Checking Number Equality

/* 
We learned how to create and store values but how do we compare them?
We need to compare numbers in situations like checking a user's entered PIN matches their
saved PIN.
*/

const enteredPIN = 5448;
const expectedPIN = 5448;

/*
To compare if two numbers are the same, we use the equality operator, ===
*/

5===5

// When comparing, there are only two results: true or false

/*
When we compare the same numbers with the equality operator, the result is true.
*/

console.log(10===10);

/* 
When we compare two different numbers with the equality operator, the result is false.
*/

console.log(9===10);

// What do we use to check if two numbers are equal?
// ===

// What does this code display in the console?
console.log(10 === 11);


// In which of these situations would we need to check if two numbers are equal?
// When checking if user's level is 10

// What does this code display in the console?
console.log(5+13);
console.log(5===13);

// Check if the value of votes is equal to 11
const votes = 10;
console.log(votes === 11);

// Add the equality comparison operator.
console.log(99===100);

// Display false in the console.
console.log(10 === 13);

// Check if these numbers are the same by typing ===
console.log(100===100);
