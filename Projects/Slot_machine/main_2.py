        The .isdigit() method is a built-in method in Python that returns True if all characters in a string are 
        digits and there is at least one character, and False otherwise. This method is useful for checking if a 
        string represents a valid integer or not. For example, the string "123" will return True when isdigit() is 
        called on it, but the string "12a3" will return False because it contains a non-digit character ('a').
