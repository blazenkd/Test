This is a test README file.

This repository will be the accumulation of lessons from FreeCodeCamp, Mimo, Sololearn, and other sources with the primary focus on the Python language. 

My idea is that it will contain a file that contains:
    a. Playground.py
        1. To be able to test random bits of code
    b. test_Timer.py
        2. To time how long it takes to construct a program based on test_Key.py
    c. test_Key.py
        3. Used as the answer key before submitting
    d. test_Blank.py
        4. As template to take the test
    e. test_new_Information.py
        5. Used to add any new concepts to test_Timer.py
    f. Any other Documents needed

Features to add:
    1. Store data of timed tests somehow (pickle?)
    2. Figure out how to run a python script while the main script is running
        - Maybe open a new window instead of just a tab?
