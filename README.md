# My Programming Progress
This repository serves as a showcase of my progress in programming. It contains folders with my work on fundamentals, projects, and a daily playground where I experiment with new ideas and techniques.

## Fundamentals
The fundamentals folder contains my notes, exercises, and code related to the fundamentals of programming. This includes topics such as data types, control structures, functions, object-oriented programming, and more.

## Projects
The projects folder contains my completed programming projects. Each project has its own folder, containing the source code, any necessary files, and a readme that explains the project and how to use it.

## Daily Playground
The daily_playground folder is a space where I experiment with new ideas and techniques. This is where I try out new programming languages, explore new frameworks, and work on small, experimental projects.

I hope you enjoy exploring my programming progress!
