# Fill in Code


# Prompt the user to enter a string


# Prompt the user to choose a case option


# Define a dictionary that maps user input to string methods

#Key "1" maps to the str.upper() method
# Key "2" maps to the str.lower() method
# Key "3" maps to the str.title() method


# Check if the user's input is a valid key in the case_map dictionary

    # If so, call the corresponding string method on the input string

    # Print the result to the console


    # If the user's input is not a valid key, print an error message
