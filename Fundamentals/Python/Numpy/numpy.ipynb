    "What is an array in python?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, an array is a collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations. \n",
    "An array can be of any data type such as integers, floating-point numbers, or strings. \n",
    "Arrays are used to store and manipulate a large number of elements efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What is contiguous memory locations?\n",
    "\n",
    "Contiguous memory locations refer to a block of memory that is allocated for storing data, where all the memory addresses are consecutive or adjacent to each other. \n",
    "In other words, the memory addresses are in a sequence with no gaps between them.\n",
    "When data is stored in contiguous memory locations, it allows for fast access and manipulation of data because the processor can access the data directly \n",
    "For example, if we have an array of integers, and the array is stored in contiguous memory locations, we can access any element in the array by simply \n",
    "calculating its memory address based on the index of the element and the size of each integer in memory.without having to go through other memory locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between an array and a list?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Types: In Python, a list can contain elements of different data types, such as integers, strings, and even other lists. On the other hand, an array is\n",
    "designed to store elements of the same data type. This is because arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations, and all elements must be of the same size.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory Management: Arrays are more efficient in terms of memory management than lists, especially when dealing with large amounts of data. This is because arrays \n",
    "allocate a single block of memory for all elements, whereas lists allocate separate blocks of memory for each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functionality: Lists offer more functionality than arrays. For example, lists have built-in methods for sorting, reversing, and appending elements, \n",
    "whereas arrays do not. Additionally, lists can be easily resized, whereas arrays have a fixed size once they are created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries: Python provides built-in support for lists, but arrays are implemented through the array module. \n",
    "Therefore, arrays may require additional code to use them in some situations.\n",
    "\n",
